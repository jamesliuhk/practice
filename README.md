# CS601 Practice exercises

I encourage students enrolled in cs601 to complete these simple practice problems before the beginning of the semester. 
In this set of practice problems, you will practice using the following:

- Java Basics: Classes&Objects, Methods, Conditionals, Iteration, Strings, Arrays, ArrayLists 
- Tools: IntelliJ, Maven, Github, JUnit

:warning: **It is expected that you solve these problems *without* looking up solutions or partial solutions on the Internet.**

## Getting Started
First, you need to install Java 12 and IntelliJ IDE (Community edition), and create an account on Github if you don't have one. 
Then clone this repository in IntelliJ and start working on the problems. You do not need to submit the solutions.

## Problems
The starter code for the practice exercises is in the following two folders: 
- src/main/java/practiceArrraysStrings 
- src/main/java/practiceOOP

### practiceArraysStrings
This folder contains classes `ArrayHelper` and `StringHelper` where you need to fill in code in several simple array and string manupulation methods.
The comment above each method explains what the method is supposed to do.
You can test these classes by running some basic Junit tests provided in classes `ArrayHelperTest` and `StringHelperTest` located in the following folder: `src/test/java/practiceArrraysStrings` 

### practiceOOP
This folder contains classes `Student`, `University` and `Driver`. Fill in code in methods of classes `Student` and `University`.  The comment above each method explains what the method is supposed to do.
This folder also contains a csv file that contains information about several students. You can use it to test your code.
The instructor provided basic JUnit tests in `StudentTest` and `UniversityTest` classes in `src/test/java/practiceOOP` to test classes `Student` and `University`.
